Airport Terminal Management System

 Project Description

The Airport Terminal Management System is a Java console application that simulates a real-world airport reservation system.

It allows users to:

- Define different types of aircraft
- Create and manage flights
- Add and retrieve passengers
- Persist flight reservations in a CSV file
- Apply loyalty program discounts

This project was built using clean, modular design principles to keep the code easy to understand, maintain, and extend.
Responsibilities are clearly separated across layers, and features like file saving, passenger management,
and loyalty discounts were implemented with flexibility in mind.
The program uses object-oriented techniques like inheritance and interfaces, and only one class handles console output
to keep things organized.
Testing and error handling were also included to support stability and future improvements.
