Shopping Cart Project Journal

Design Overview
The Shopping Cart application began with a clean package structure designed around separating responsibilities.
Early planning included reviewing real-world shopping cart flows like Amazon's to guide how cart interactions should feel.
Inspired by that, I created the application to include clear user prompts, item quantity control, and cart review before removal.

The initial design was broken into six focused packages:
	• MainApp – Entry point that handles control flow and menu routing
	• ShoppingCartService – Core business logic: add, remove, display, and checkout
	• CartItem (model) – Represents individual items in the cart
	• ConsoleUI – Manages user input/output (menus, prompts, error messages)
	• Utils – Formats currency and keeps display logic clean
    •  CartOperations – Interface for cart behavior
Each class is focused on a single responsibility, allowing features to be maintained or expanded easily.
